## Version 0.7d
### Malpedia Description:
```
RedPacket Security describes NJRat as "a remote access trojan (RAT) has 
capabilities to log keystrokes, access the victim's camera, steal 
credentials stored in browsers, open a reverse shell, upload/download 
files, view the victim's desktop, perform process, file, and registry 
manipulations, and capabilities to let the attacker update, uninstall, 
restart, close, disconnect the RAT and rename its campaign ID. Through 
the Command & Control (CnC) server software, the attacker has capabilities 
to create and configure the malware to spread through USB drives."

It is supposedly popular with actors in the Middle East. Similar to other 
RATs, many leaked builders may be backdoored.
