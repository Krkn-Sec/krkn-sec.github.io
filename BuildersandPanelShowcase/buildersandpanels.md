# Builders and Panels Showcase

---

I wanted to create this section to provide people with some insight into the eyes of the threat actors. We hear about these malware all the time but we rarely see the view from the threat actor's eyes.

I at least found these interesting. I hope someone else does too.

Specifically from a malware analysis perspective, it allows me to see the different options that might be available when building the executables which is helpful.
